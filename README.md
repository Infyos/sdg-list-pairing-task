# SDG List

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are a collection of 17 global goals adopted by all United Nations Member States. They are designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all".

Set up in 2015, and anticipated to be achieved by 2030, these goals – to name a few – seek to realise human rights of all, achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, eradicate poverty in all its forms everywhere and end world hunger.

### Purpose

The purpose of this application is to display the SDGs in a format that sustainability experts can use to reference each goal.
